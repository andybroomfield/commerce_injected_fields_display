# Commerce Injected Fields Display
Allows the product variation injected fields to be ordered on the manage display screen

Problem... When using the injected fields for product variations, its not possible to alter the position of the injected fields with manage display.
This module solves that by creates a pseudo field for the injected fields.

Very much work in progress...
